<h2>Inspiration</h2>

This modloader was inspired by [Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap), an open-source, alternative bootstrapper for Roblox.

Bloxstrap is what introduced me to the Roblox modding community, their discord members have given great feedback on my journey as a Roblox modder, none of this would have been possible without them.
