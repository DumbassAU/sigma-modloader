<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>

This project is inspired by <a href='https://github.com/Fishstrap/Fishstrap'>Sigmastrap</a>, an bootstrapper for Gooblox with no extra features. Sigmastrap is what introduced me to the world of Gooblox mewing and what led to me creating my own jawline. However, at the time of writing this, Sigmastrap’s mod support is not limited, even more so when you are managing and developing many different mods at the same time. Because of this, I’ve decided to build my own software dedicated to Gooblox mewing.
