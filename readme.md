<h2>Inspiration & Goals</h2>

This project was inspired by <a href='https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap'>Bloxstrap</a>, an open-source, alternative bootstrapper for Roblox.
Bloxstrap is what introduced me to the Roblox modding community and where I learned many different ways to improve my mods. Not being able to switch between custom mod profiles and mod priorities is what led to me creating my own modloader.
<br></br>
My goals for this project are:
<ul>
    <li>
        Introducing more people to Roblox mods
    </li>
    <li>
        Getting more experience with Python
    </li>
    <li>
        Getting experience in managing discord servers
    </li>
    <li>
        Learning how to make a website
    </li>
</ul>
